- Strengthen Personalization Capabilities: Develop mechanisms to tailor interactions further, possibly by asking more targeted questions about financial goals or leveraging (with consent) past interaction data to customize responses and suggestions.
- Standardize Inclusion of Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs): Implement a strategy for consistently including relevant and actionable CTAs at the end of chatbot responses to improve conversion rates and user guidance.
- Enrich Responses with Direct Links and Dynamic Content: Where appropriate and feasible, provide direct links to comprehensive resources (e.g., security FAQs, detailed product pages) and explore integrating dynamic content (e.g., current e-commerce offers) for a richer user experience.
- Expand Question Sets for Specific Needs: For certain client types like 'rural_new_adopter', broaden the scope of initial questions to cover specific financial products or government schemes they might be interested in.
- Incorporate Interactive Elements: Consider adding simple interactive tools like calculators or short quizzes to increase engagement and provide more personalized guidance, especially for users newer to digital platforms.
- Ensure Consistent Inclusion of Necessary Disclaimers: Standardize the inclusion of important disclaimers, such as those related to the dynamic nature of security information or investment advice, to maintain transparency and manage expectations.
