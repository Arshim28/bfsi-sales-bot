## Client Types

### tech_savvy_millennial

This client type represents young, digitally native individuals comfortable with using mobile banking and online financial services. They are likely in their 20s or 30s, employed, and actively seeking convenient and efficient ways to manage their finances. They are drawn to YONO's integrated platform that combines banking, payments, investments, and lifestyle services in one app. They appreciate the ease of use, 24/7 accessibility, and features like UPI transfers, mobile bill payments, and online shopping offers. They are also interested in exploring investment options and loan products available through the app, and appreciate the digital loan application process. They value the time-saving aspect of YONO and are likely to adopt features like YONO Cash for ATM withdrawals without a physical card. They are comfortable with minimal human interaction and prefer self-service options. This client type is a key driver of YONO's high transaction volume and new savings account growth.

### rural_new_adopter

This client type represents individuals from rural or semi-urban areas who are relatively new to digital banking. They may have previously relied solely on traditional brick-and-mortar banking services. They are drawn to YONO due to its accessibility and the convenience of banking from their smartphones, especially given SBI's extensive branch network in rural areas. They are likely to be initially hesitant about using digital services and may require more guidance and support. The video KYC account opening feature is particularly appealing to them, as it eliminates the need to physically visit a branch. They are interested in basic banking services like funds transfer and bill payments and may be exploring loan options for agricultural or small business purposes. They appreciate the availability of YONO in regional languages and the potential for increased financial inclusion. This client type represents a significant growth opportunity for SBI, as they transition from traditional to digital banking.
