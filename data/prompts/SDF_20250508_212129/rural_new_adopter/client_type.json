  "description": "This client type represents individuals from rural or semi-urban areas who are relatively new to digital banking. They may have previously relied solely on traditional brick-and-mortar banking services. They are drawn to YONO due to its accessibility and the convenience of banking from their smartphones, especially given SBI's extensive branch network in rural areas. They are likely to be initially hesitant about using digital services and may require more guidance and support. The video KYC account opening feature is particularly appealing to them, as it eliminates the need to physically visit a branch. They are interested in basic banking services like funds transfer and bill payments and may be exploring loan options for agricultural or small business purposes. They appreciate the availability of YONO in regional languages and the potential for increased financial inclusion. This client type represents a significant growth opportunity for SBI, as they transition from traditional to digital banking."
