    "question": "If I send money to someone using YONO, how will I know if they actually received it?",
    "response": "Namaste! I understand you're wondering how you'll know if someone received money you sent through YONO. That's a very important question! Here's how it works:\n\nAfter you send money using YONO, you'll receive an immediate confirmation on your screen. This confirmation will include a transaction reference number. Think of it like a receipt for your transfer.\n\nBut that's not all! YONO also provides these ways to track your payment:\n\n1.  **Transaction History:** You can check your transaction history within the YONO app. It lists all your past transactions, including the one you just made. The status will show as either 'Successful' (meaning the money reached the recipient), 'Pending' (meaning it's still being processed), or 'Failed' (meaning the transfer didn't go through).\n2.  **SMS Alerts:** SBI usually sends an SMS (text message) to your registered mobile number confirming that the transaction was successful. This message serves as another confirmation that the money has been sent.\n3.  **UPI Apps (if applicable):** If you used UPI to send the money, you can also check the transaction status within the UPI app you used (like BHIM). These apps usually provide a detailed history of all UPI transactions.\n\nIf the status shows as 'Pending' for longer than expected (usually a few hours), or if it shows as 'Failed,' please check your account balance to ensure the money wasn't deducted. If the money was deducted and the transaction failed, please contact SBI customer care immediately, either through the YONO app or by visiting your nearest branch. They will be able to investigate the issue and resolve it for you.\n\nUsing YONO for sending money is very secure, and these confirmation methods ensure you always know the status of your transactions. We want to make sure you feel confident and comfortable using our digital services!",

    "question": "Is it safe to put all my banking information on my phone? What if my phone gets lost or stolen?",
    "response": "Namaste! I understand your concern about the safety of putting your banking information on your phone, especially considering the possibility of it getting lost or stolen. It's a very valid question, and I'm happy to explain how SBI YONO keeps your information secure. \n\nThink of YONO as a very secure vault on your phone. Here's how we protect your banking information:\n\n*   **Multiple Layers of Security:** YONO uses several security measures. First, you have your phone's own security, like a PIN, fingerprint, or face unlock. Then, YONO itself requires a separate login ID and password. For transactions, we often use One-Time Passwords (OTPs) sent to your registered mobile number. This means even if someone gets hold of your phone and knows your YONO password, they still need that OTP to complete a transaction.\n\n*   **Encryption:** All the information that travels between your phone and SBI's servers is encrypted. This means it's scrambled in a way that makes it unreadable to anyone who might try to intercept it. It's like sending a letter in a secret code.\n\n*   **Device Binding:** YONO can be linked to only one device at a time. If someone tries to log in to your account from a different phone, they will be blocked and you'll be notified.\n\n*   **What to do if your phone is lost or stolen:** If your phone is lost or stolen, the first thing to do is immediately call SBI's customer care. They can block your YONO account to prevent any unauthorized access. You can also de-register your device by logging into YONO from another device or through internet banking, if available. Then, you can get a new SIM card with the same mobile number, and register YONO on a new phone.\n\n*   **YONO Cash:** If you use YONO Cash to withdraw money from ATMs without a debit card, remember that this feature also requires an OTP, adding another layer of security.\n\n*   **SBI's Commitment:** SBI invests heavily in security technologies and processes to protect your money and information. We are constantly monitoring for fraudulent activity and updating our security measures to stay ahead of potential threats.\n\nSo, while it's wise to be cautious, rest assured that SBI YONO incorporates robust security measures to protect your banking information. Remember to keep your passwords strong and never share your OTP with anyone. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask!",

    "question": "Can I use YONO in my local language, or is it only in English and Hindi?",
    "response": "Namaste! I understand you're wondering about the language options available on SBI YONO. That's a great question! \n\nWhile YONO is certainly available in English and Hindi, I'm happy to tell you that SBI recognizes the importance of serving our customers in their preferred languages. To best answer your question, please check the application settings once you have downloaded the app, to check if your local language is available. This feature is especially helpful for our customers in rural and semi-urban areas who are more comfortable banking in their native language.\n\nWith YONO, you can enjoy the convenience of banking from your smartphone, including features like:\n\n*   **Funds Transfer:** Easily send money to friends and family using UPI/BHIM.\n*   **Video KYC Account Opening:** Open an account without needing to visit a branch in person.

    "question": "I heard I can withdraw money from an ATM without my card using YONO. How does that work, and is it safe?",
    "response": "Namaste! I understand you're curious about withdrawing money from an ATM without your card using YONO. It's a great feature called 'YONO Cash' and it's designed to be both convenient and safe. Let me explain how it works and address your safety concerns.\n\nHere\u2019s how YONO Cash works:\n\n1.  **Initiate the Withdrawal:** You start the process on your YONO app. Log in and select 'YONO Cash'.\n2.  **Enter Amount and Set PIN:** You'll enter the amount you want to withdraw and set a temporary 6-digit YONO Cash PIN. This PIN is crucial, so remember it!\n3.  **Visit an SBI ATM:** Go to any SBI ATM that supports YONO Cash. These ATMs will display the YONO Cash option on the screen.\n4.  **Enter Details at ATM:** At the ATM, select 'YONO Cash' on the screen. You'll be prompted to enter the YONO Cash PIN you created in the app, as well as the reference number you received on your registered mobile number via SMS.\n5.  **Collect Your Cash:** Once you've entered the correct details, the ATM will dispense your cash.\n\n**Now, about safety:**\n\nYONO Cash is very secure for a few reasons:\n\n*   **Two-Factor Authentication:** It requires both your YONO app login and the separate YONO Cash PIN, making it difficult for someone else to withdraw money even if they have your card.\n*   **Temporary PIN:** The YONO Cash PIN is only valid for a limited time (usually a few hours), so even if someone were to learn your PIN, they wouldn't be able to use it after it expires.\n*   **No Card Needed:** Since you don't need your physical card, there's no risk of card skimming or theft at the ATM.\n*   **SMS Alerts:** You'll receive SMS alerts throughout the process, so you'll be notified if any YONO Cash transaction is initiated.\n\nEssentially, YONO Cash adds extra layers of security compared to using your physical card. It's a convenient way to withdraw money without worrying about card theft or skimming. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions. We also have video tutorials available in regional languages within the YONO app that might be helpful.",

      "YONO Cash allows cardless ATM withdrawals through the YONO app.",
      "The process involves initiating the withdrawal in the app, setting a temporary PIN, and then using that PIN along with a reference number at a YONO Cash enabled SBI ATM.",
      "YONO Cash is secure because it uses two-factor authentication (app login and separate PIN) and the PIN is only valid for a short period.",
      "Not needing a physical card eliminates the risk of card skimming or theft.",
      "SMS alerts notify you of any YONO Cash transactions."
