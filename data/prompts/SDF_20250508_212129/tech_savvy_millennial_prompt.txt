## Q1: How secure is YONO for making UPI transactions, especially considering the increasing number of online fraud cases?

Context: This client is digitally savvy but also aware of cybersecurity risks. They want assurance that YONO has robust security measures in place to protect their funds during UPI transfers.

Response: Hey there! Thanks for asking about YONO's security for UPI transactions. I understand your concern, especially with online fraud on the rise. Security is a top priority for us at SBI, and we've built YONO with several layers of protection to keep your money and information safe. 

Here’s a breakdown of how we ensure your UPI transactions on YONO are secure:

1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication:** YONO uses multi-factor authentication. This means that in addition to your password or PIN, you may need to use a one-time password (OTP) sent to your registered mobile number or biometric authentication (like fingerprint or facial recognition) to complete transactions. This makes it much harder for unauthorized users to access your account, even if they somehow get hold of your login details.

2.  **Secure App Environment:** The YONO app itself is designed with robust security protocols. We regularly update the app with the latest security patches to protect against vulnerabilities. We also employ encryption to protect your data while it's being transmitted between your device and our servers.

3.  **UPI PIN Security:** For every UPI transaction, you need to enter your UPI PIN. This PIN is known only to you and is not stored by SBI. Always keep this PIN confidential and never share it with anyone.

4.  **Transaction Limits:** YONO allows you to set transaction limits for UPI payments. This limits the amount that can be transacted in a single transaction or over a period of time, which can help mitigate potential losses in case of fraud.

5. **Real-time Monitoring:** SBI employs advanced fraud detection systems that monitor transactions in real-time for suspicious activity. If a transaction is flagged as potentially fraudulent, it may be blocked or delayed, and you may be contacted to verify its authenticity.

**Important Tips for You:**

*   **Keep your app updated:** Always use the latest version of the YONO app to benefit from the newest security features and bug fixes.
*   **Be cautious of phishing:** Be wary of suspicious emails, messages, or phone calls asking for your personal or financial information. SBI will never ask for your sensitive information through these channels.
*   **Use a strong UPI PIN:** Choose a UPI PIN that is difficult to guess and avoid using easily identifiable information like your birthdate or phone number.
*   **Monitor your transactions regularly:** Keep an eye on your account activity and report any unauthorized transactions immediately.

We are committed to providing a secure and convenient banking experience with YONO. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask!

Key points:
- YONO uses multi-factor authentication, including OTPs and biometrics, for enhanced security.
- The YONO app is regularly updated with security patches and employs encryption to protect your data.
- UPI PIN is crucial for authorizing transactions and should be kept confidential.
- Transaction limits can be set to mitigate potential losses from fraudulent activities.

4.  **Bank Statements:** Statements showing your transaction history (typically for the last 6 months) may be needed to assess your repayment capacity.

Keep in mind, the specific document requirements might vary slightly depending on your individual profile and SBI's current policies. The YONO app will clearly outline exactly what you need to upload during the application process.
