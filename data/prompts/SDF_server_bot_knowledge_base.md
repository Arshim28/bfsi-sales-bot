### Q1: How secure is YONO for making UPI transactions, especially considering the increasing number of online fraud cases?

Answer: Hey there! Thanks for asking about YONO's security for UPI transactions. I understand your concern, especially with online fraud on the rise. Security is a top priority for us at SBI, and we've built YONO with several layers of protection to keep your money and information safe. 

Here’s a breakdown of how we ensure your UPI transactions on YONO are secure:

1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication:** YONO uses multi-factor authentication. This means that in addition to your password or PIN, you may need to use a one-time password (OTP) sent to your registered mobile number or biometric authentication (like fingerprint or facial recognition) to complete transactions. This makes it much harder for unauthorized users to access your account, even if they somehow get hold of your login details.

2.  **Secure App Environment:** The YONO app itself is designed with robust security protocols. We regularly update the app with the latest security patches to protect against vulnerabilities. We also employ encryption to protect your data while it's being transmitted between your device and our servers.

3.  **UPI PIN Security:** For every UPI transaction, you need to enter your UPI PIN. This PIN is known only to you and is not stored by SBI. Always keep this PIN confidential and never share it with anyone.

4.  **Transaction Limits:** YONO allows you to set transaction limits for UPI payments. This limits the amount that can be transacted in a single transaction or over a period of time, which can help mitigate potential losses in case of fraud.

5. **Real-time Monitoring:** SBI employs advanced fraud detection systems that monitor transactions in real-time for suspicious activity. If a transaction is flagged as potentially fraudulent, it may be blocked or delayed, and you may be contacted to verify its authenticity.

**Important Tips for You:**

*   **Keep your app updated:** Always use the latest version of the YONO app to benefit from the newest security features and bug fixes.
*   **Be cautious of phishing:** Be wary of suspicious emails, messages, or phone calls asking for your personal or financial information. SBI will never ask for your sensitive information through these channels.
*   **Use a strong UPI PIN:** Choose a UPI PIN that is difficult to guess and avoid using easily identifiable information like your birthdate or phone number.
*   **Monitor your transactions regularly:** Keep an eye on your account activity and report any unauthorized transactions immediately.

We are committed to providing a secure and convenient banking experience with YONO. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask!

Key points:
- YONO uses multi-factor authentication, including OTPs and biometrics, for enhanced security.
- The YONO app is regularly updated with security patches and employs encryption to protect your data.
- UPI PIN is crucial for authorizing transactions and should be kept confidential.
- Transaction limits can be set to mitigate potential losses from fraudulent activities.
- SBI employs real-time monitoring and fraud detection systems to identify and block suspicious transactions.

4.  **Bank Statements:** Statements showing your transaction history (typically for the last 6 months) may be needed to assess your repayment capacity.

Keep in mind, the specific document requirements might vary slightly depending on your individual profile and SBI's current policies. The YONO app will clearly outline exactly what you need to upload during the application process. The app also gives real-time updates on your application status, so you're never left wondering what's happening.

## rural_new_adopter Questions

### Q1: If I send money to someone using YONO, how will I know if they actually received it?

Answer: Namaste! I understand you're wondering how you'll know if someone received money you sent through YONO. That's a very important question! Here's how it works:

After you send money using YONO, you'll receive an immediate confirmation on your screen. This confirmation will include a transaction reference number. Think of it like a receipt for your transfer.

But that's not all! YONO also provides these ways to track your payment:

1.  **Transaction History:** You can check your transaction history within the YONO app. It lists all your past transactions, including the one you just made. The status will show as either 'Successful' (meaning the money reached the recipient), 'Pending' (meaning it's still being processed), or 'Failed' (meaning the transfer didn't go through).
2.  **SMS Alerts:** SBI usually sends an SMS (text message) to your registered mobile number confirming that the transaction was successful. This message serves as another confirmation that the money has been sent.
3.  **UPI Apps (if applicable):** If you used UPI to send the money, you can also check the transaction status within the UPI app you used (like BHIM). These apps usually provide a detailed history of all UPI transactions.

If the status shows as 'Pending' for longer than expected (usually a few hours), or if it shows as 'Failed,' please check your account balance to ensure the money wasn't deducted. If the money was deducted and the transaction failed, please contact SBI customer care immediately, either through the YONO app or by visiting your nearest branch. They will be able to investigate the issue and resolve it for you.

Using YONO for sending money is very secure, and these confirmation methods ensure you always know the status of your transactions. We want to make sure you feel confident and comfortable using our digital services!

Key points:
- You'll receive an immediate on-screen confirmation with a transaction reference number.
- Check your transaction history within the YONO app for the status (Successful, Pending, or Failed).
- SBI usually sends an SMS to your registered mobile number confirming successful transactions.
- If the status is 'Pending' for too long or 'Failed,' contact SBI customer care.
- You can also check the transaction status in any UPI app you used to send the money.

### Q2: Is it safe to put all my banking information on my phone? What if my phone gets lost or stolen?

Answer: Namaste! I understand your concern about the safety of putting your banking information on your phone, especially considering the possibility of it getting lost or stolen. It's a very valid question, and I'm happy to explain how SBI YONO keeps your information secure. 

Think of YONO as a very secure vault on your phone. Here's how we protect your banking information:

*   **Multiple Layers of Security:** YONO uses several security measures. First, you have your phone's own security, like a PIN, fingerprint, or face unlock. Then, YONO itself requires a separate login ID and password. For transactions, we often use One-Time Passwords (OTPs) sent to your registered mobile number. This means even if someone gets hold of your phone and knows your YONO password, they still need that OTP to complete a transaction.

*   **Encryption:** All the information that travels between your phone and SBI's servers is encrypted. This means it's scrambled in a way that makes it unreadable to anyone who might try to intercept it. It's like sending a letter in a secret code.

*   **Device Binding:** YONO can be linked to only one device at a time. If someone tries to log in to your account from a different phone, they will be blocked and you'll be notified.

*   **What to do if your phone is lost or stolen:** If your phone is lost or stolen, the first thing to do is immediately call SBI's customer care. They can block your YONO account to prevent any unauthorized access. You can also de-register your device by logging into YONO from another device or through internet banking, if available. Then, you can get a new SIM card with the same mobile number, and register YONO on a new phone.

*   **YONO Cash:** If you use YONO Cash to withdraw money from ATMs without a debit card, remember that this feature also requires an OTP, adding another layer of security.

*   **SBI's Commitment:** SBI invests heavily in security technologies and processes to protect your money and information. We are constantly monitoring for fraudulent activity and updating our security measures to stay ahead of potential threats.

So, while it's wise to be cautious, rest assured that SBI YONO incorporates robust security measures to protect your banking information. Remember to keep your passwords strong and never share your OTP with anyone. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask!

Key points:
- YONO uses multiple layers of security, including device-level security, YONO login, and OTPs.
- All data transmitted between your phone and SBI servers is encrypted.
- If your phone is lost or stolen, you should immediately contact SBI customer care to block your YONO account.
- YONO can be linked to only one device at a time, preventing unauthorized access from other devices.
- SBI is committed to investing in security technologies and processes to protect your information.

### Q4: I heard I can withdraw money from an ATM without my card using YONO. How does that work, and is it safe?

Answer: Namaste! I understand you're curious about withdrawing money from an ATM without your card using YONO. It's a great feature called 'YONO Cash' and it's designed to be both convenient and safe. Let me explain how it works and address your safety concerns.

Here’s how YONO Cash works:

1.  **Initiate the Withdrawal:** You start the process on your YONO app. Log in and select 'YONO Cash'.
2.  **Enter Amount and Set PIN:** You'll enter the amount you want to withdraw and set a temporary 6-digit YONO Cash PIN. This PIN is crucial, so remember it!
3.  **Visit an SBI ATM:** Go to any SBI ATM that supports YONO Cash. These ATMs will display the YONO Cash option on the screen.
4.  **Enter Details at ATM:** At the ATM, select 'YONO Cash' on the screen. You'll be prompted to enter the YONO Cash PIN you created in the app, as well as the reference number you received on your registered mobile number via SMS.
5.  **Collect Your Cash:** Once you've entered the correct details, the ATM will dispense your cash.

**Now, about safety:**

YONO Cash is very secure for a few reasons:

*   **Two-Factor Authentication:** It requires both your YONO app login and the separate YONO Cash PIN, making it difficult for someone else to withdraw money even if they have your card.
*   **Temporary PIN:** The YONO Cash PIN is only valid for a limited time (usually a few hours), so even if someone were to learn your PIN, they wouldn't be able to use it after it expires.
*   **No Card Needed:** Since you don't need your physical card, there's no risk of card skimming or theft at the ATM.
*   **SMS Alerts:** You'll receive SMS alerts throughout the process, so you'll be notified if any YONO Cash transaction is initiated.

Essentially, YONO Cash adds extra layers of security compared to using your physical card. It's a convenient way to withdraw money without worrying about card theft or skimming. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions. We also have video tutorials available in regional languages within the YONO app that might be helpful.

Key points:
- YONO Cash allows cardless ATM withdrawals through the YONO app.
- The process involves initiating the withdrawal in the app, setting a temporary PIN, and then using that PIN along with a reference number at a YONO Cash enabled SBI ATM.
- YONO Cash is secure because it uses two-factor authentication (app login and separate PIN) and the PIN is only valid for a short period.
- Not needing a physical card eliminates the risk of card skimming or theft.
- SMS alerts notify you of any YONO Cash transactions.
