  "description": "This client type resides in a rural area and is newly adopting digital banking services. They may have limited prior experience with technology and require simple, accessible solutions. The widespread SBI branch and ATM network provides a sense of security, and they are drawn to YONO's ability to facilitate basic transactions like fund transfers and bill payments without needing to travel long distances to a branch. They require clear, jargon-free explanations of YONO's features and benefits, and may need assistance in setting up and using the app. They value trust and reliability, and appreciate the association with a well-established bank like SBI. Features like YONO Cash for ATM withdrawals can be particularly appealing in areas with limited banking infrastructure."
