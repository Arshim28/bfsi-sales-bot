  "description": "This client type is primarily interested in opening a savings account and managing their funds effectively. They may be new to banking or looking for a more convenient and accessible option. They are attracted by the high adoption rate of YONO for new savings accounts and the ease of opening an account through video KYC. They may not be highly sophisticated in their financial knowledge, so they appreciate clear and simple explanations of account features and benefits. They are likely to use YONO for basic transactions like fund transfers and monitoring their account balance. They may also be interested in learning about other financial products offered through YONO, such as insurance and investment options, but will need a gentle and informative approach."
