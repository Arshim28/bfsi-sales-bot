I understand you'd like to know about any associated fees. \n\nGenerally, using YONO for your savings account offers a lot of convenience with minimal fees.

However, it's always a good idea to check for any potential ATM usage fees if you're using an ATM outside of SBI's network, although this wouldn't be directly related to YONO itself.\n*   **Account Services:** Standard account services accessible through YONO, like requesting a cheque book or updating your address, may have associated charges as per SBI's general banking policy. These charges are usually the same whether you request them online or at a branch. You can find the most up-to-date schedule of charges on the SBI website or by contacting customer service.\n*   **No Hidden Charges:** SBI is committed to transparency, so there are no hidden fees specifically for using the YONO app itself to manage your savings account. The fees you might encounter are standard banking charges that would apply regardless of whether you use YONO or another method.\n\nTo get the most precise information on specific fees related to your account type, I recommend checking the detailed schedule of charges on the SBI website or contacting customer service.
